# Security policy

Security is of paramount importance to the project. We do all we can to identify and fix
issues, however some problems might slip through the cracks. Any efforts towards responsible
disclosure of security problems are greatly appreciated and your contributions will be acknowledged.

## Our disclosure policy

All security vulnerabilities affecting the Parsec provider - including those reported using the steps
highlighted below, those discovered during routine testing, and those found in our dependency tree
either through `cargo-audit` or otherwise - will receive [security
advisories](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-openssl-provider/security/advisories) in a timely 
manner. The advisories should include sufficient information about the cause, effect, and possible 
mitigations for the vulnerability. If any information is missing, or you would like to raise a question 
about the advisories, please open an issue in [our repo](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-openssl-provider).

Efforts to mitigate for the reported vulnerabilities will be tracked using Github issues linked to
the corresponding advisories.

## Reporting a vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to
[cncf-parsec-maintainers@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-parsec-maintainers@lists.cncf.io). We will reply
to acknowledge your report and we'll strive to keep you in the loop as we try to reach a resolution.
